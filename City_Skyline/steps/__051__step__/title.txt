Step  51

Gradient transitions often gradually change 
from one color to another. When a 
more abrupt change is required, the transition 
can be made with a hard stop 
like this:
Example Codelinear-gradient(
  var(--first-color) 0%,
  
var(--first-color) 40%,
  var(--second-color) 40%,
  var(--second-color) 
80%
);

Add a linear-gradient to .bb2b that uses 
--building-color2 from 0% to 6% and --window-color2 
from 6% to 9%.
