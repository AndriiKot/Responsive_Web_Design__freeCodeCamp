Step  14

Now you have something that 
is resembling a building. You are ready 
to create your first variable. Variable declarations 
begin with two dashes (-) and are 
given a name and a value like 
this: --variable-name: value;. In the rule for 
the bb1 class, create a variable named 
--building-color1 and give it a value of 
#999.
