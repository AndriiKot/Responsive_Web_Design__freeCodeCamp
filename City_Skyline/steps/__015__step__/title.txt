Step  15

To use a variable, put 
the variable name in parentheses with var 
in front of them like this: var(--variable-name). 
Whatever value you gave the variable will 
be applied to whatever property you use 
it on.
Add the variable --building-color1 you created 
in the previous step as the value 
of the background-color property of the .bb1a 
class.
