Step  25

That didn't work, because the 
variables you declared in .bb1 do not 
cascade to the .bb2 and .bb3 sibling 
elements. That's just how CSS works. Because 
of this, variables are often declared in 
the :root selector. This is the highest 
level selector in CSS; putting your variables 
there will make them usable everywhere. Add 
the :root selector to the top of 
your stylesheet, and move all your variable 
declarations there.
