Step  54

Create and add the following 
properties to .bb2a:
Example Codemargin: auto;
width: 5vw;
height: 5vw;
border-top: 
1vw solid #000;
border-bottom: 1vw solid #000;
border-left: 1vw 
solid #999;
border-right: 1vw solid #999;

After you add 
these, you can see how a thick 
border on an element gives you some 
angles where two sides meet. You are 
going to use that bottom border as 
the top of the building.
