Step  40

Gradients in CSS are a 
way to transition between colors across the 
distance of an element. They are applied 
to the background property and the syntax 
looks like this:
Example Codegradient-type(
  color1,
  
color2
);

In the example, color1 is solid at 
the top, color2 is solid at the 
bottom, and in between it transitions evenly 
from one to the next. In .bb1a, 
add a background property below the background-color 
property. Set it as a gradient of 
type linear-gradient that uses --building-color1 as the 
first color and --window-color1 as the second.
