Step  71

You can set browser behavior 
by adding meta elements in the head. 
Here's an example:
Example Code&lt;meta attribute="value"&gt;

Inside the head 
element, nest a meta element with an 
attribute named charset. Set to the value 
to utf-8 which tells the browser how 
to encode characters for the page.
Note that 
the meta element is a void element.
With 
that last change, you have completed the 
Cat Photo App project. Congratulations!
