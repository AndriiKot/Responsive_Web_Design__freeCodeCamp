Step  58

There's another way to associate 
an input element's text with the element 
itself. You can nest the text within 
a label element and add a for 
attribute with the same value as the 
input element's id attribute.
Given an input element 
as below:
Example Code&lt;input id="breakfast" type="radio" name="meal" value="breakfast"&gt;

An 
example of a label element that is 
associated to this input element is:
Example Code&lt;label 
for="breakfast"&gt;Breakfast&lt;/label&gt;

Associate the text Loving with the checkbox 
by nesting only the text Loving in 
a label element and giving it an 
appropriate for attribute.
