Step  50

Notice that both radio buttons 
can be selected at the same time. 
To make it so selecting one radio 
button automatically deselects the other, both buttons 
must have a name attribute with the 
same value.
Here is an example of two 
radio buttons with the same name attribute:
Example 
Code&lt;input type="radio" name="meal"&gt; Breakfast
&lt;input type="radio" name="meal"&gt; Lunch

Add 
the name attribute with the value indoor-outdoor 
to both radio buttons.
