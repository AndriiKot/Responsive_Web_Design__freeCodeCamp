Step  18

Before adding any new content, 
you should make use of a section 
element to separate the cat photos content 
from the future content.
The section element is 
used to define sections in a document, 
such as chapters, headers, footers, or any 
other sections of the document. It is 
a semantic element that helps with SEO 
and accessibility.
Example Code&lt;section&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Section Title&lt;/h2&gt;
  
&lt;p&gt;Section content...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

Take your h2, p, and anchor 
(a) elements and nest them in a 
section element.
