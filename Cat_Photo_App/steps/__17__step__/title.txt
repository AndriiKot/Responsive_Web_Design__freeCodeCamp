Step  17

In previous steps you used 
an anchor element to turn text into 
a link. Other types of content can 
also be turned into a link by 
wrapping it in anchor tags.
Here is an 
example of turning an image into a 
link:
Example Code&lt;a href="example-link"&gt;
  &lt;img src="image-link.jpg" alt="A 
photo of a cat."&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

Turn the image into 
a link by surrounding it with necessary 
element tags. Use https://freecatphotoapp.com as the anchor's 
href attribute value.
