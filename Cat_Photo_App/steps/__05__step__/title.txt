Step  5

HTML5 has some elements that 
identify different content areas. These elements make 
your HTML easier to read and help 
with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility.
The 
main element is used to represent the 
main content of the body of an 
HTML document. Content inside the main element 
should be unique to the document and 
should not be repeated in other parts 
of the document.
Example Code&lt;main&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Most important 
content of the document&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Some more 
important content...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/main&gt;

Identify the main section of this 
page by adding a &lt;main&gt; opening tag 
before the h1 element, and a &lt;/main&gt; 
closing tag after the p element.
